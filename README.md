# HTML Index
A python script that generates index.html files for file indexing.

## Usage
Simply type `index <path>`. Replace the `<path>` with the path to the directory you want to generate indexes for.

For example: `index ./`

## Note
It'll ignore any file that starts with a `.`

## Customizing
Under `html-index/assets`, there are several files.
* `__file_template.html`
    * This is the template for indexed files, edit it if you want to change how the indexed files look.
* `__index_template.html`
    * This is the template for the `index.html`, edit it if you want to change how the whole index looks.
* `__icons/`
    * Where all the icons are located.
* `icons.yml`
    * The icon settings.
        * Note that it's currently generated by a script and still needs configuration.
